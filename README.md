# Airbnb_Price_Analysis
This project focuses on analysing Airbnb pricing across 10 European cities. The goal is to determine the factors that influence listing prices, such as room type, location, cleanliness rating, host status, and proximity to the city center. We will explore patterns in pricing for weekends vs weekdays and compare insights across cities.
